The Plugin Works by disabling the ability for the player to go through the End Portal. Other means such as TP still work but anything involving going though the end portal doesnt.


# Installation

First install the .jar file from the releases.

Then move that file to the `/plugins` folder inside your server!

If you see a message like `Successfully loaded NoEnd!!` on the console that means you installed it correctly!!

# How to use

The Plugin Works automatically and does not have any commands.
